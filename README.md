# First time learning Swift!
This is actually my first time trying swift out, and I'm following along with the official tutorial on Apple's website.

To be honest, it feels quite good, it's somewhat similar to React, except for you don't have css stuff, but instead there is some methods that defined the style of a component or an element.

Xcode is pretty nice by the way.
